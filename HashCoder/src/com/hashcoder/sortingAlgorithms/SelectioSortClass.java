/*The selection sort is a combination of searching and sorting.
 *During each pass, the unsorted element with the smallest (or largest) value is moved to its proper position
 *in the array. The number of times the sort passes through the array 
 *is one less than the number of items in the array. 
 *In the selection sort, the inner loop finds the next smallest (or largest) value 
 *and the outer loop places that value into its proper location. -
